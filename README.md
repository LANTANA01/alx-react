## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Introduction

Webpack is a powerful module bundler that can bundle JavaScript files for browser usage. It can also handle other resources like CSS, images, and more. Here's a quick overview:

- Bundles ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules.
- Supports code splitting for loading parts of the application on demand.
- Resolves dependencies during compilation, reducing runtime size.
- Utilizes loaders to preprocess files (e.g., TypeScript to JavaScript, CSS, images).
- Extensible via plugins.

## Concepts

### Plugins

Webpack's rich plugin interface allows you to enhance its functionality. Some commonly used plugins include:

- **mini-css-extract-plugin**: Extracts CSS into separate files.
- **compression-webpack-plugin**: Prepares compressed versions of assets.
- **html-webpack-plugin**: Simplifies HTML file creation.
- **pug-plugin**: Renders Pug files to HTML.

### Loaders

Webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files beyond JavaScript. You can write your own loaders or use existing ones to handle various resources.

## Getting Started

1. Check out Webpack's [quick Get Started guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) for an introduction.
2. Explore the other guides to learn more about specific features.

## Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (except IE8 and below). If you need to support older browsers, consider loading a Promise polyfill before using dynamic imports (`import()` and `require.ensure()`).

## Contributing

Every early webpack user who contributed by writing issues or PRs deserves a shoutout! Feel free to contribute to this project by opening issues or submitting pull requests.
